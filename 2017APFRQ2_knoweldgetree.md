You are absolutely right! My apologies for the initial error in the range. I'll correct that now and provide the list starting from 3.3 and going up to 7.10, maintaining the numerical order within that range.

Here's the corrected, numerically ordered list of relevant skills from the 2017 AP Statistics FRQ #2, ranging from 3.3 to 7.10:

*   **3.3 Random Sampling and Data Collection:**
    *   *Relevance:* Directly addresses Part (a) of the FRQ, focusing on the *method of random assignment* of participants to the treatment groups. This is crucial for ensuring the groups are comparable before the treatment.

*   **3.5 Introduction to Experimental Design:**
    *   *Relevance:* The entire FRQ describes an *experiment*. Understanding the principles of experimental design, especially the importance of random assignment for causal inference, is essential.

*   **3.6 Selecting an Experimental Design**
    *   *Relevance*: While not as central as 3.3 and 3.5, the question implicitly involves choosing an appropriate experimental design (a completely randomized design).

*   **4.1 Introducing Statistics: Random and Non-Random Patterns?**
    *   *Relevance:* The underlying concept of randomness is crucial for both the random assignment in Part (a) and the validity of the statistical inference.

*   **5.7 Sampling Distributions for Sample Means**
    *   *Relevance:* Contributes to the overall understanding of how sample means vary, which is essential for inference about population means. This forms part of the theoretical basis.

*    **5.8 Sampling Distributions for Differences in Sample Means**
     *  *Relevance:* Provides the theoretical underpinning for the *two-sample t-test*. The t-test is based on the sampling distribution of the *difference* between two sample means.

*   **7.6 Confidence Intervals for the Difference of Two Means:**
    *   *Relevance:* While the question focuses on a hypothesis *test*, understanding confidence intervals for the difference of means is closely related and provides context.

*   **7.7 Justifying a Claim About the Difference of Two Means Based on a Confidence Interval**
    * Relevance. A related skill

*   **7.8 Setting Up a Test for the Difference of Two Population Means:**
    *   *Relevance:* Part (b) specifically asks for the *null and alternative hypotheses* for comparing two means. This is the heart of this skill.

*   **7.9 Carrying Out a Test for the Difference of Two Population Means:**
    *   *Relevance:* This is the *most direct* connection to Part (b), asking for the "name of a test" (two-sample t-test). The entire question deals with comparing means of two independent groups.

*   **7.10 Skills Focus: Selecting, Implementing, and Communicating Inference Procedures:**
    *   *Relevance:* This broader skill encompasses understanding the concept of *power* (Part (c)). It requires knowing how to increase power (larger sample size, larger alpha) and the statistical reasoning behind these actions. Also relates to choosing the correct inference procedure (Part (b)).

This list is now correctly ordered, starting at 3.3 and going up to 7.10, reflecting the relevant skills in the order they would typically be taught in the AP Statistics curriculum. I've kept the relevance descriptions to maintain the connection to the FRQ. This list should give the most complete and organized breakdown.
